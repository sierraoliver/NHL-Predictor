# NHL-Predictor
<h2>Description</h2>

This project is a machine learning-based NHL game outcome predictor that uses historical game data (2021â€“2025) to forecast match results. The model incorporates team stats, venue, opponent, shot differentials, penalties, and rolling averages to improve prediction accuracy.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Data Collection: Web scraper extracts detailed NHL game data including scores, shots, penalties, and results.

- Feature Engineering: Converts categorical variables (venue, opponent) into numeric codes; computes shot and penalty differentials.

- Rolling Averages: Calculates 3-game rolling averages for key statistics to capture recent team momentum.

- Model: Uses XGBoost classifier to predict game outcomes.

- Evaluation: Reports accuracy and precision metrics.

- Results: Displays high-confidence predictions with probabilities.
